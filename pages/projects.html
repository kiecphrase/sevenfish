            <h3>Beverage Based Color Palette</h3>
            <p>20250321</p>

            <p>While drinking my favorite energy drink brand, who I will not explicitly say in the hopes that they don't care enough to yell at me, I acknowledged that I really like the colors they use for their cans.</p>
            <p>From what I can find, there's not really an explicit list of what these colors are, but through hard work, determination, and google chrome extensions, I found them:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>#6851ad - Spring Edition</li>
                <li>#e87bac - Pink Edition</li>
                <li>#f28c0f - Amber Edition</li>
                <li>#71b03e - Green Edition</li>
                <li>#007fbf - Sea Blue Edition</li>
                <li>#006ab0 - Coconut Edition (text)</li>
                <li>#26266e - Blue Edition</li>
                <li>#f5c400 - Yellow Edition</li>
                <li>#c43123 - Red Edition (watermelon)</li>
                <li>#182569 - Original Blue</li>
                <li>#0094d4 - Sugar Free Blue</li>
                <li>#a0c6eb - Zero (monk fruit)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I'll add to the list when they come out. I may also start keeing track of the flavors and my opinions on them.</p>

            <h3>Anything But Windows 11</h3>
            <p>20250322</p>
            
            <p>Unfortunately, or fortunately, I don't like working with Windows 11. I don't like the forced AI, I don't like the reimagining of the UI layout, <br> and maybe it's all because I'm stubborn, but before I <i>have to use Windows 11</i>, I'd like to see if I can figure out a workaround.</p>
            <p>The goal of this project would be to replace Windows functionality of the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Steam</li>
                <li>Music Production in Ableton</li>
                <li>programming</li>
                <li>discord</li>
                <li>ease of maintenance similar to Windows</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Currently, I'm thinking I can make a Steam Machine with SteamOS, maybe get a mac for Ableton, and then some Linux distro for everything else. <br> Possibly, it will be easiest to suck it up and use Windows 11 for some of this, but I'd like to minimize Windows 11 as much as possible.</p>
