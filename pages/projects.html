                <p>While drinking my favorite energy drink brand, who I will not explicitly say in the hopes that they don't care enough to yell at me, <br>I acknowledged that I really like the colors they use for their cans. From what I can find, there's not really an explicit list of what these colors are, <br>but through hard work, determination, and google chrome extensions, I found them.</p>
                <p>I'll add to the list when they come out. I may also start keeping track of the flavors and my opinions on them.</p>

                <h5>20250419</h5>
                <p>Started using this for this website. Make it a bit more personal, lol.</p>

                <h5>20250620</h5>
                <p>Went to Japan, discovered purple Grape flavor. Gotta find it somehow and rip it.</p>
                <p>Then I remembered I have paint, so I downloaded my image, took a few samples, then averaged them to get the color.</p>

            <div id="anythingbutwindows_body" class="no_c">
                <h5>20250322</h5>
                <p>Unfortunately, or fortunately, I don't like working with Windows 11. I don't like the forced AI, I don't like the reimagining of the UI layout, <br> and maybe it's all because I'm stubborn, but before I <i>have to use Windows 11</i>, I'd like to see if I can figure out a workaround.</p>
                <p>The goal of this project would be to replace Windows functionality of the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Steam</li>
                    <li>Music Production in Ableton</li>
                    <li>programming</li>
                    <li>discord</li>
                    <li>ease of maintenance similar to Windows</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Currently, I'm thinking I can make a Steam Machine with SteamOS, maybe get a mac for Ableton, and then some Linux distro for everything else. <br> Possibly, it will be easiest to suck it up and use Windows 11 for some of this, but I'd like to minimize Windows 11 as much as possible.</p>

                <h5>20250404</h5>
                <p>Apparently steamOS isn't really a thing? Or at least it's not as supported as I initially thought. Still going to try and put one together though, <br> but other projects are slightly more important right now.</p>

                <h5>20250501</h5>
                <p>The development server I run had the idea to dedicate a month to figuring out linux. As this ties is really well with this project, <br> I decided to make it into my Q3 project for this year.</p>

                <h5>20250510</h5>
                <p>Another potential setback...Ableton seems to only support Mac and Windows. I've never been a huge fan of the Apple Ecosystem, <br> though through networking I have learned to appreciate it. I'll probably need to either suck it up, learn a new software, <br> or accept that I may need Win11 for music.</p>

                <h5>20250518</h5>
                <p>Started working in Ubuntu for a different project. Very windows like. A buddy of mine already uses is as a daily driver. I could be convinced...</p>

                <h5>20250510</h5>
                <p>Had an idea to make my own VST for a while. I have a few audio effect chains set up in Ableton, and I thought it'd be fun to try and figure out how to make and share it as a VST. <br> Didn't really ever think about how to go about doing it, googled it a couple of times, and finally found <a href="https://juce.com/">JUCE</a>.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, all of this is C++. It's been years since I did C++. I'm going to have to relearn C++.</p>

                <h5>20250517</h5>
                <p>Got the inspiration from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDW1wokbRiQ&ab_channel=wrongdogreckons">this video</a> to try and make an alternative to streaming services by replicating the TV watching experience from when I was a young child. <br>I decided if I were to do this, I could make an entire process out of it and call it a learning experience.</p>
                <p>Step one is digitizing my physical media. To do that, I decided the best thing to do was to try to get <a href="https://b3n.org/automatic-ripping-machine/">A.R.M.</a> working. I decided for no real reason to use Ubuntu 24.04 instead of the only supported OS (Ubuntu 20.04).<br> This and not reading led to massive problems that are easily fixed with a clean install.</p>

                <h5>20250518</h5>
                <p>A clean install was the best choice to make progress. After finally finding my install media I made yesterday (I have 7 of the same USB), I took note of user info and made it my only user in the OS to simplify the process.<br> Install was pretty easy following the guide, the only real issue was manually granting permissions for every made folder and rerunning the first step in <a href="https://github.com/automatic-ripping-machine/automatic-ripping-machine/wiki/General-Troubleshooting">this guide</a>.</p>
                <p>Currently testing, hoping for the best. I only gave my container 1 core from a gen 7 i5 so speed is not an attribute of my system currently.</p>

                <h5>20250520</h5>
                <p>Got it working, got it stable, added a core, most rip within 2 hours (except for any Lord of the Rings movies).</p>

                <h5>20250620</h5>
                <p>At this point, ARM is working just fine for US media. I have discovered however that it won't work on Japanese DVDs (no Totoro for me :/).</p>
                <p>I have 2 options: give up, or find a work around. From what I've found, you can safely change the region of a DVD drive between 4 and 5 times before it locks. So I <i>may</i> be able to build a monster system to  have DVD players <br> for each of the 4 regions. It'll be one hell of a power sync though, so I think I'll try to "unlock" a DVD player first before doing anything else.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I think I'm confident enough to convert something else into an ARM <i>and then</i> through a graphics card into it to see if I can optimize some of the cheap hardware I'm barely using. <br> I have my eye on my old Farming Sim server that isn't really being used anymore. The hardware is <i>extremely</i> similar to my current ARM</p>
